/**
 * lb-bot: what the library is *missing*.
 *
 * lb-bot keeps a per-artist MusicBrainz discography index and a Soulseek
 * acquisition pipeline that can fill a gap — a release the library doesn't have
 * at all, or the three tracks missing from one it does.
 *
 * HUB ONLY, unlike [AudioMuseManager] next door. That one keeps a direct-LAN
 * fallback because AudioMuse has a bearer token of its own; lb-bot's Flask API has
 * no authentication whatsoever and exposes delete-file and trash routes, so the
 * hub's route whitelist is the only gate that exists. There is deliberately no
 * direct route here, and no lb-bot address is ever stored on the device: no hub
 * means the feature is simply off.
 *
 * FAIL-SOFT everywhere. A missing hub, an unset LBBOT_URL upstream, an unreachable
 * lb-bot and a never-indexed artist all resolve to "render nothing" — the artist
 * page must look exactly as it does today whenever this layer is absent.
 *
 * NOTE for future edits: do not write a route path containing a slash-star
 * sequence inside a comment. Kotlin block comments nest, and one of those swallows
 * the rest of the file behind an "Unclosed comment" at EOF.
