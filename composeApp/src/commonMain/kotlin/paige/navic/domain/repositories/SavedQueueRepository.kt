/**
 * The store behind the Symfonium-style "saved queues" list. Owns the rolling cache of automatically
 * captured queue snapshots (capped at [MAX_QUEUES], oldest by `updatedAt` evicted) and the encode /
 * decode of the queue blob.
 *
 * [upsert] is called from the player's central state observer on every debounced change, so it is
 * written to be cheap: an unchanged queue (the common case — a progress tick) only moves the cursor
 * via [SavedQueueDao.updateProgress] instead of re-encoding the whole `List<DomainSong>`.
 *
 * A record's identity is a **listening session**, not a track list: `sourceName` and `coverArtId` are
 * stamped when the queue is born and never rewritten, and [findMatching] recognises a queue we already
 * have a record for so replaying an album refreshes its card instead of cloning it. Both rules mirror
 * Feishin and the hub (`hub.py._upsert_saved_queue`), which is the point — all three render one shared
 * history.
